         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS <hi>DIVINE, RATIONAL</hi> and <hi>POLITICAL,</hi> calculated for the preſent ſtate of Affairs in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and offered to the Conſideration of every true-hearted ENGLISH-MAN.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>COnſider,</hi> That the ancient Government of this Nation by KING, Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, is in it ſelf the moſt equal and well tempered Government of any in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider,</hi> The Renown and Felicity of this Nation, which continued many hundred years under that Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The many Violences acted upon the Parliament, eſpecially the Force which was upon the Houſe of Commons when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended law was made for the alteration of that Government, being contrary to the expreſs Oaths, Declarations and Reſolutions thereof whileſt free.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Deſign of the Chief Actor of thoſe Villanies, and Contriver of that Law was for advancing himſelf to the regall Dignity, which it hath pleaſed God to confound to the perpetual reproach of him, his Relations and Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Conſider,</hi> The general contempt and poverty which God hath brought upon the Nation, ſince the change by ſubjecting us to the Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Baſeſt of the people, who have Exalted themſelves by the Ruine of their Superiors, whereby we are become a ſhame to our ſelves and a ſcorn and deriſion to all our Neighbours.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That it is deſtructive to the Liberties of the people that the Legiſlative Power ſhould reſide in a Multitude of Commoners without any Checque upon them, <hi>Probatum eſt,</hi> there having been more horrid oppreſſions by High Courts of Juſtice and other Exorbitant arbitrary Laws Acted in the <hi>Inter-regnum,</hi> then ever was done by colour of Authority in the Reigns of all the KINGS of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. That Atheiſme. Ignorance, Sacriledge, Factions, and Hereſies the Fruits and Nurſlings of this alteration, have crouded out Piety, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Charity, Uniformity and ſound Doctrine, wherein the Glory of this Nation did formerly excel moſt in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That it is the undoubted Birth-right of <hi>Charls Stuart</hi> to be KING of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. That the People of the three Nations beſides the Obligation of their Natural duty are bound by their Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Proteſtation and Covenant to endeavour his Reſtitution.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That it is the earneſt deſire of all the Nobility, Gentry and ſober Comonalty, except only ſuch whoſe peculiar Advantages or dreadful conſciences cauſe them to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That during his Exile the three Nations have been under perpetual Enmities, tremblings and Changes without any Foundations of Peace or Government.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That it is impoſſible without his concurrance to eſtabliſh any Government that ſhall be binding to the People.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That the Pretenders to the preſent Power (perſons ſo worthleſs that it is a ſhame for the Nation to ſubmit unto them) have by meer Force without colour of right excluded their Fellow Members, much greater in Number and Quality then themſelves; and therefore the Laws made by them during that Force (admit otherwiſe they had good Authority) cannot in juſtice Challenge obedience from the people.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Conſider,</hi> The vaſt Impoſitions wherewith the Pretenders do Oppreſs the Nations for ſupporting of Souldiers, whoſe whole <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mployment is only to ſuppreſs thoſe that Endeavour the KING'S Reſtitution; and the evident Neceſſity of continuing them for that End.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That the Soldiers are in truth the Supreme Governours, and have only delegated their Power to the Pretenders whom they have advanced and ſupported, ejected and reſtored as they pleaſed: it being no leſs truly then wittily ſaid, <hi>That they are the Parliaments Army and thoſe are the Armies Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. That this Power is now devolved upon and executed by the Common Soldiers, who knowing their own ſtrength, have gotten the hand of their Officers, and caſhiere and re-admit them with the ſame facility and pleaſure that the Officers have done their Governors.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>Conſider,</hi> The total decay of Trade throughout the three Nations occaſioned by the Diſturbances and Oppreſſions at home, and Fears from abroad, impoveriſhing the meaner ſort, and reducing them to that Neceſſity which will ſoon force them to Violences; and the ſmall hopes of its return till our rightful PRINCE be <hi>Reſtored.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>Conſider,</hi> The great effuſion of Blood and Ruines of Eſtates which muſt neceſſarily happen if he be reſtored by Force, either at Home or from abroad, againſt either of which we can never be ſecured, and now more eſpecially the latter, conſidering the league between the two potent Princes his Allies, by whom the opportunity of employing their ſuper-numerary Forces on ſuch an occaſion will doubtleſſe be imbraced.</p>
            <p n="19">19. That it is the undoubted Deſign of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> who have tried his ſtedfaſtneſſe in Religion, to prevent his reſtitution by his ſubjects, that he may be Neceſſitated to flye unto Forrain power for effecting it, (the moſt probable means of introducing Popery) for which purpoſe they are come over in Swarms, and in private Congregations, more especially amongſt the Soldiers (with whom they have mingled themſelves under the Diſguiſes of more plauſible Factions) do ſow the Seeds of perpetual Enmities as well againſt him as among our ſelves, and ſome of them have boldly affirmed that he ſhall never be reſtored but by their means.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>Conſider,</hi> This reſtitution by treaty in a Free Parliament, the Secluded Members being readmitted, places Vacant ſupplyed by Free Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and both Secluded and new Elected Members to be admitted without any Oath previous to their Seſſion is the moſt hopeful means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling different parties, providing for tender conſciences, eaſing us of the burthen of Soldiers (their Arrears being paid before disbanding, and they admitted to the uſe of any trade) ſecuring purchaſers under the States title by an Act for confirmation of Sales, appeaſing Fears and Jealouſies, by a Free and General pardon, uniting the three Nations and ſetling peace with our Neihghours, advancing Trade, preſerving of Liberties, and reſtoring the Honour of the Nation; and if this be not affected, certainly it is the viſible judgement of God upon us, who for our ſins infatuates our Counſels, that we cannot diſcern, or dejects our ſpirits that we dare not attempt, or diſappoints our enterpriſes that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain the means of our deliverance.</p>
